		<h1>Jess and Jim's California Coast Honeymoon Adventure</h1>
		
		<div class="preamble">
			
			<p>Many months before our wedding Jess had a <em>really good idea</em>. Instead of the 
				usual multiple-day stressful lead up to our wedding day, instead of flying, 
				instead of driving, we would ride our bikes the 515 miles from our apartment
				in San Francisco to Jess's parents' house, our wedding venue, in Long Beach 
				just South of LA.</p>
				
			<p>We (mostly Jess) got to work planning. Her number one condition was that 
				we stayed in the best hotels we could along the route. She wasn't going 
				to be roughing it after a full day in the saddle. Every hotel was booked, 
				every breakfast, lunch and dinner was planned. Massages were arranged at
				strategic locations. The ride was planned long before wedding planning 
				had even begun.</p>
				
			<p>The trip turned out to be the best thing we've ever done. Spending 
				that time together in the days leading up to our wedding brought us together
				like we hadn't been before. It was magical.</p>
