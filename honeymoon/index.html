		<h1>Jess and Jims' California Coast Honeymoon Adventure</h1>

		<article class="preamble">

			<p><cite>By <a href="http://jimwhimpey.com">Jim Whimpey</a></cite></p>

			<p>Many months before our wedding Jess had a <em>really good idea</em>. Instead of the
				usual multiple-day stressful lead up to our wedding day, instead of flying,
				instead of driving, we would ride our bikes the 515 miles from our apartment
				in San Francisco to Jess's parents' house, our wedding venue, in Long Beach
				just South of LA.</p>

			<p>We (mostly Jess) got to work planning. Her number one condition was that
				we stayed in the best hotels we could along the route. She wasn't going
				to be roughing it after a full day in the saddle. Every hotel was booked,
				every breakfast, lunch and dinner was planned. Massages were arranged at
				strategic locations. The ride was planned long before wedding planning
				had even begun.</p>

			<p>The trip turned out to be the best thing we've ever done. Spending
				that time together in the days leading up to our wedding brought us together
				like we hadn't been before. It was magical.</p>

			<p>Time to go. Everything was packed days ago. A friend organized a big group
				roll out with our friends for the first 10 miles or so down the coast. It's
				nice to have our friends there but the whole thing is a bit overwhelming. Suddenly,
				thankfully, we're on our own.</p>

			<p>We get through Pacifica to Devil's Slide and get our first serious view of the
				ocean. We still have some nervous energy that we talk about and make a conscious
				decision to rid ourselves of. A ripping tail wind is making everything feel easy. We're at
				Pescadero before 10am and it's an easy decision to add 4 miles for the artichoke bread.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20914925790/" title="Peacekeepers"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/758/20914925790_8a64c44acb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Peacekeepers"></a>

			<p>The road got smoother and the tail wind stronger the closer to Santa Cruz we got.
				It gets particularly nice around Davenport where the road is recently repaved and lined
				by cliffs on the left and surf beaches on the right. It would be the easiest 40 mile stretch
				of our entire trip.</p>

			<p>After a quick stop to stock up on chamois cream we got to our hotel feeling pretty fresh.
				Our room not yet ready we washed our kit in the pool bathroom, hung it out to dry, ordered
				cocktails and laid by the pool. By 5pm we were sick of screaming kids and retreated to
				<a href="http://www.lupulosc.com">L&#250;pulo Craft Beer House</a> where we spent a good hour
				and got a bit drunk.</p>

			<p>Dinner was at <a href="http://assembleforfood.com">Assembly</a> which I can't recommend highly
				enough. The food was incredible, the atmosphere was friendly and warm, the service impeccable
				and it was one of the most inexpensive dinners we had all trip.</p>

			<p>Jess had heard that Everclear (who've been playing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(band)">
				25 years</a>) were playing a free show on the beach. I was tired and reluctant but it was
				my first time at the Santa Cruz waterfront and it was surprisingly fun. I wanted to go
				on a roller coaster or play in the arcade but we had no locks and no where to put the bikes.
				We watched Everclear until "Heroin Girl", rode back to the hotel and crashed.</p>

		<h2>Day 2: Santa Cruz to Big Sur</h2>
		<h3><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/369844552">92.3 miles, 4714 feet</a></h3>

			<p class="date">Saturday, August 15th 2015</p>

			<p>South of Santa Cruz was new riding territory for us both. I'd mapped routes using
				a combination of the most direct and the most popular sections of road on Strava.
				We knew the riding from Monterey to Big Sur would be spectacular and hadn't really
				thought about what it'd be like before that. It turned out to be stunning.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20689397570/in/dateposted-public/" title="Strawberry Fields forever between Santa Cruz and Monterey on day 2"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/640/20689397570_638bb4511e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Strawberry Fields forever between Santa Cruz and Monterey on day 2"></a>

			<p>For miles and miles we passed perfectly aligned strawberry fields, kale, artichoke
				and flower farms. In parts the farms were hives of activity but the roads were quiet
				and the weather was perfect. We had a super long lunch at <a href="http://happygirlkitchen.com/blogs/journal">
				Happy Girl Kitchen</a> in Monterey and packed some of their amazing vegan snickerdoodle
				cookies in our bags for later.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately our trip clashed with the the annual <a href="http://www.pebblebeachconcours.net">
				Pebble Beach Concouse d'Elegance motor show</a> which meant we could only ride part
				of 17 Mile Drive. We convinced the security guard to let us ride the final section
				but not before a brutally hot and steep climb away from the coast.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20872060662/in/dateposted-public/" title="End of day 2: entering Big Sur"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/583/20872060662_911559b568_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="End of day 2: entering Big Sur"></a>

			<p>Big Sur was expectedly spectacular. The Bixby Canyon Bridge is the subject of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-szw05TwQk">
				one of my favorite songs</a> so we spent a bit of time there taking in the scenery and
				watching waves of Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McClarens and Maseratis roll by.</p>

			<p>The day's ride got progressively hillier and I knew we finished with the longest climb of the day.
				It was also <em>hot</em>. Only 3 miles out as we approached the final climb Jess and I debated
				stopping for a drink. She just wanted to get there but I made us stop. We drank an ice cold coke
				on a the ground of a dirty gas station and that moment was honestly one of the highlights of
				the whole trip. I had routed us to the <a href="http://www.postranchinn.com">Post Ranch Inn</a>
				driveway entrance but it only climbed further from there. We arrived drenched in sweat, dirty and
				unable to talk as another Ferrari pulled into the car park.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20712425550/in/dateposted-public/" title="A nice place to finish a ride"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/692/20712425550_579a8d424f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="A nice place to finish a ride"></a>

			<p>Post Ranch was overwhelmingly luxurious. We justified it with the "honeymoon" title. Our cabin was
				huge, our bed was a cloud, there was champaign on ice awaiting us, the minibar was well stocked
				and 100% complimentary. After a shower that looks out into the forest we waste no time getting
				to the hot tub with a view 1200ft above the ocean.
				There's no one around, it's quiet, the water is 104&#8457;, we've raided the beer, coke, wine and chips
				from our minibar and we can see humpback whales migrating below. It was unreal.</p>

			<p>Dinner is at the Post Ranch restaurant on the property. It is a four course vegan extravaganza
				with most of it coming from their own garden. We're there for hours. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20717624350">
				from our table</a> we can see nothing but ocean and we eat so much we can barely move. Day two
				is a complete success.</p>

			<p class="date">Sunday, August 16th 2015</p>

			<p>Our first and only rest day. We slept as late as we could without missing the breakfast time
				cut. Breakfast was an insane all you can eat spread. Again we ate until we thought we would
				explode. When we got back to our room our minibar had been restocked including the a cookie
				jar fogged up by the warmth of the freshly baked cookies. We decided going out for lunch
				was going to be unnecessary.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20286218974/in/dateposted-public/" title="On the third day we rested"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/696/20286218974_6cba5503bf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the third day we rested"></a>

			<p>Many months in advance Jess booked us massages. Our legs needed it.</p>

			<p>Post Ranch has a network of private trails through the forest and we walked through them really
				slowly on the way to check out other stuff. We found the the huge vegetable and flower garden,
				a nest and the mercantile. We found the big pool and sat in it for an hour to cool off.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20916921782/in/dateposted-public/" title="Entering a nest"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/563/20916921782_3b42f0f90c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Entering a nest"></a>

			<p>Still full from two consecutive massive meals we got sandwiches delivered for dinner to the hot
				tub. We spent five hours eating, drinking, watching the sunset and chatting to a few
				other guests. Given our next day would be our biggest it was a perfect afternoon. Another day would have
				been too indulgent.</p>

			<p>The queen stage.</p>

			<p>We'd organized the night before to have breakfast delivered to our favorite hot tub at 6:30am.
				Post Ranch were happy to oblige. We got to watch the sun rise over a thick cloud of fog
				sitting over the ocean hundreds of feet below. We finished our fruit and granola, got on
				our bikes and descended into the cold, wet fog we were just watching from above.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20310059113/in/dateposted-public/" title="Day 4: Exiting Big Sur"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5755/20310059113_cae720b0a0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Day 4: Exiting Big Sur"></a>

			<p>The next couple of hours would be the only time all week we felt like we needed warmer
				clothes on the bike. The worst part about the fog was that we couldn't see the ocean
				we were following on what's supposed to be some of the most beautiful parts of the California
				coast. The plus side was that the few cars that were on the road were very slow and cautious.
				Despite not being able to see the ocean, we could almost always hear it.</p>

			<p>Sometimes towards the top of a climb we'd peak out of the fog only to drop back in a
				moment later. After our past two very hot riding days it was partially a relief.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20668797069/in/datetaken/" title="Untitled"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/719/20668797069_50bd71e448_b.jpg" width="1024" height="536" alt="Untitled">

			<p>As we left Big Sur the road got flatter, straighter and we settled into a nice rhythm. Just
				North of San Simeon we came to the <a href="http://sansimeonchamber.org/attractions/elephant-seals/">
				Piedras Blancas rokcery</a> home to a huge family of elephant seals! Jess had read all about it
				but kept it a surprise for me. They've built a boardwalk right no the beach and you can get super
				close.</p>

			<p>Lunch was an incredibly fast, cheap and delicious vege burger, salad and fries in Cayucos.
				The next 20 miles or so we headed inland through the strange Los Osos with a ripping tailwind. The
				final 15 miles, 100 to 115, we turned into the wind through San Luis Obispo and it was rough.</p>

			<p>We rolled into The Cliffs Resort at 4pm, our latest arrival all trip, really tired. They told
				us our room wasn't ready yet and we lost patience 10 minutes later and demanded a room. We
				had an incredible top floor room with a view over the pool and out to the ocean. The pool was
				a cacophony of kids so we got room service and just sat in the sun on our balcony until
				dinner time. It was really nice.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20748065258/in/dateposted-public/" title="Our longest day yet brings us to Pismo Beach"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/646/20748065258_6c41c947fc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Our longest day yet brings us to Pismo Beach"></a>

			<p>I barely remember what we had for dinner that night or when we went to bed. Oh, waiting for us
				when we arrived were a fresh pair of bibs Jess had delivered from <a href="http://machinesforfreedom.com">
				Machines for Freedom</a> which literally saved her butt for the rest of the trip.</p>

		<h2>Day 5: Pismo Beach to Santa Barbara</h2>
		<h3><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/372063389">90.3 miles, 4338 feet</a></h3>

			<p class="date">Tuesday, August 18th 2015</p>

			<p>We knew today wasn't going to be the most spectacular as far as riding goes and
				that there was going to be a great hotel waiting for us in Santa Barbara so our
				plan was to leave right at sunrise and smash out the 90 miles with minimal stopping.
				The inland route took us back through farmland, pretty much following the train line
				that heads down the west coast.</p>

			<a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jimwhimpey/20767193589/in/dateposted-public/" title="I highly recommend riding your bike 500 miles to your wedding"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5647/20767193589_f2f533b43c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="I highly recommend riding your bike 500 miles to your wedding"></a>

			<p>Half way we hit the town of Lompoc which I'd never heard of before. I ate entire
				can of Pringles myself and drank a bottle of coke. Jess had an iced coffee. By this point
				both our chains were starting to get a little raw and I didn't bring chain lube. I stopped
				at a car mechanic but he sprayed WD40 on them before I could stop him. Luckily there was a
				Home Depot just up the road where I bought some real lube before getting out of there.</p>

			<p>A very long but steady climb followed where I struggled but Jess excelled.</p>

			<p>INSERT SIGN CROSSROADS PIC HERE</p>

			<p>The final 20 miles into Santa Barbara were really tough. The only option is the shoulder of the
				101 with cars flying past at 70mph. There was a cone placed in the shoulder every 100ft which
				made things more stressful. It was the worst stretch of road to ride on the entire trip. Despite
				that we'd still made great time all day and rolled into the golden archway of
				<a href="http://www.bacararesort.com"> Bacara at around 1pm.</p>
