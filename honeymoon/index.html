		<h1>Jess and Jim's California Coast Honeymoon Adventure</h1>

		<article class="preamble">

			<p><cite>By <a href="http://jimwhimpey.com">Jim Whimpey</a></cite></p>

			<p>Many months before our wedding Jess had a <em>really good idea</em>. Instead of the
				usual multiple-day stressful lead up to our wedding day, instead of flying,
				instead of driving, we would ride our bikes the 515 miles from our apartment
				in San Francisco to Jess's parents' house, our wedding venue, in Long Beach
				just South of LA.</p>

			<p>We (mostly Jess) got to work planning. Her number one condition was that
				we stayed in the best hotels we could along the route. She wasn't going
				to be roughing it after a full day in the saddle. Every hotel was booked,
				every breakfast, lunch and dinner was planned. Massages were arranged at
				strategic locations. The ride was planned long before wedding planning
				had even begun.</p>

			<p>The trip turned out to be the best thing we've ever done. Spending
				that time together in the days leading up to our wedding brought us together
				like we hadn't been before. It was magical.</p>

			<p>Time to go. Everything was packed days ago. A friend organized a big group
				roll out with our friends for the first 10 miles or so down the coast. It's
				nice to have our friends there but the whole thing is a bit overwhelming. Suddenly,
				thankfully, we're on our own.</p>

			<p>We get through Pacifica to Devil's Slide and get our first serious view of the
				ocean. We still have some nervous energy that we talk about and make a conscious
				decision to rid ourselves of. A ripping tail wind is making everything feel easy. We're at
				Pescadero before 10am and it's an easy decision to add 4 miles for the artichoke bread.</p>

			<p>The road got smoother and the tail wind stronger the closer to Santa Cruz we got.
				It gets particularly nice around Davenport where the road is recently repaved and lined
				by cliffs on the left and surf beaches on the right. It would be the easiest 40 mile stretch
				of our entire trip.</p>

			<p>After a quick stop to stock up on chamois cream we got to our hotel feeling pretty fresh.
				Our room not yet ready we washed our kit in the pool bathroom, hung it out to dry, ordered
				cocktails and laid by the pool. By 5pm we were sick of screaming kids and retreated to
				<a href="http://www.lupulosc.com">L&#250;pulo Craft Beer House</a> where we spent a good hour
				and got a bit drunk.</p>

			<p>Dinner was at <a href="http://assembleforfood.com">Assembly</a> which I can't recommend highly
				enough. The food was incredible, the atmosphere was friendly and warm, the service impeccable
				and it was one of the most inexpensive dinners we had all trip.</p>

			<p>Jess had heard that Everclear (who've been playing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everclear_(band)">
				25 years</a>) were playing a free show on the beach. I was tired and reluctant but it was
				my first time at the Santa Cruz waterfront and it was surprisingly fun. I wanted to go
				on a roller coaster or play in the arcade but we had no locks and no where to put the bikes.
				We watched Everclear until "Heroin Girl", rode back to the hotel and crashed.</p>
